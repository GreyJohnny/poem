# ⚡ 偶遇 (Encounter)

---


一片漆黑，  
在本该微亮的蓝天里。  
&nbsp;  
细沉的云还在吗？  
只有灯亮着。  
&nbsp;  
裁剪后的淡薄纸片打在黑幕上，  
看不清，有很多次，很短。  
&nbsp;  
一些冷酷，一些寂寞，  
**闪电在落下。** &nbsp;  
眼睛也没放弃捕捉。  
不断发出的预言，  
不断设想的预演。  
&nbsp;  
很疑惑，又很恐惧。  
&nbsp;  
仆从匆匆赶到，  
进入到我的耳朵里，  
传来失落的沉闷。  
&nbsp;  
**想来一场偶遇！** &nbsp;  
它悄然降临，即使被预料到。  
耀眼的白，亲自来欢迎我。  
不是投影，不是仆从。  
&nbsp;  
这不再是设想，  
这不再是未知。  
&nbsp;  
我动弹不得，  
**我张开双臂！** &nbsp;  
因为石沉大海，本是幸福。  
**没有什么，比已经的定数，更让人安心。**

# ⚡ Encounter

---


Pitch black,  
In the blue sky that should have been faintly lit.  
&nbsp;  
Are the thin, heavy clouds still there?  
Only the lamps remain alight.  
&nbsp;  
Thin, cropped paper scraps strike the black curtain,  
Blurry, frequent, and fleeting.  
&nbsp;  
A bit of coldness, a bit of loneliness,  
**Lightning is descending.** &nbsp;  
The eyes never ceased their capture.  
Prophecies issued incessantly,  
Rehearsals imagined repeatedly.  
&nbsp;  
Deeply puzzled, deeply afraid.  
&nbsp;  
The servants arrive in a hurry,  
Deep into my ears,  
Bringing a heavy, lost thud.  
&nbsp;  
**I long for an encounter!** &nbsp;  
It descends quietly, even if foretold.  
A dazzling white, welcoming me in person.  
No longer a projection, no longer a servant.  
&nbsp;  
This is no longer a hypothesis,  
This is no longer the unknown.  
&nbsp;  
I am paralyzed,  
**I open my arms wide!** &nbsp;  
For the stone sinking into the sea was happiness after all.  
**Nothing brings more peace than a fate already sealed.**
